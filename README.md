## The App

  It's a project that can be used to handle your files. Using it anyone can organize a computer fast even if there are hundrets of files. That's because instead of trying to short your files by hand
  it allows you to make it fast using some automation. It was first developed to help with cleaning useless files from the downloads directory on windows. When you first setup a computer you have to install a lot of app installers
  and they take space and they also make it exctremly difficult to locate a file that is important after some time.

## Demo

You start with your initial directory you want to tide up:

you start the programm and you enconter the main menu:

we get the absolute path of the file in out terminal

let's choose to find a folder:

we also get the absolute path of the folder

if we choode to organize the files by their extension this will be the result:
